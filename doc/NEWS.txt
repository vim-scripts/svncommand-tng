2006.08.10  1.76.2
    - Added the SVNCommitDiff from 1.67.2 into this script
    - Added a new option, SVNAutoCommitDiff, that sets up the autocommands 
      neccessary to gracefully run the SVNCommitDiff() function when a
      svn-commit.* file is loaded.
    - Updated the documentation with the new options/functions

2006.07.12  1.76.1
    - Updated to be based on version of 1.76 of cvscommand.vim. The 
      differences were so great that I pulled a fresh copy of cvscommand.vim
      and went from there
    - Added a Property Edit Function
    - svk support is gone (maybe I'll put it back in sometime, or you are
      welcome to)
